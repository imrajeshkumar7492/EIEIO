C*O Technology Positions

A number of C-level technology related positions have been created in local governance in the last few years, from traditional Chief Information Officer and Chief Technology Officer, to newer descriptions including Chief Data Officer, Chief Innovation Officer and others.  This repo is meant as a source of C*O position descriptions and other relevant information for the creation of these leadership tech position in the civic sector.

The repo stems out of unconference discussions from [CfASummit 2013](http://cfasummit.org/).

For a start, see https://github.com/smathermather/EIEIO/blob/master/links.md

For the time being, these will be external links.  In the future, markdown docs will be recreated for each of these to ensure that when the external links die, the examples live on (see e.g. [CIO, City of Palo Alto](https://github.com/smathermather/EIEIO/blob/master/md/cio-palo-alto.md)).  Also, some summary docs be created to highlight commonalities between documents.
